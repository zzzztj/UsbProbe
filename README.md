# UsbProbe
Simple USB Probe
The idea behind this small app is to interrogate a USB device to return it's parameters such as inputs and outputs.
This is the start of an app that will unify a wide range of USB devices to a single device for configuration
in a single application.  Specifically, for Flight Simulators.
